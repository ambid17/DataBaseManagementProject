To run PHP scripts:

go to file explorer and navigate to the following file:
C:/wamp64/www/index.php

delete all of the text in the file, and copy/paste my index.html script in.
add in two files to the same location(C:/wamp64/www/): player.php, checkPlayer.php

Then, open a web browser and type "localhost" in the address bar.

The script should automatically run when the previous has been done correctly.
